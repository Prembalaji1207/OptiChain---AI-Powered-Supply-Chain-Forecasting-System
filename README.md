#  Supply Chain Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

**Domain:** Retail & Supply Chain Analytics | **Tech Stack:** Python, XGBoost, Power BI, Pandas, NumPy

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on **forecasting weekly product demand** across multiple Walmart stores and optimizing **inventory levels** using advanced analytics.

It combines **machine learning** and **supply chain management (SCM)** principles to accurately predict sales trends and calculate **Safety Stock** and **Reorder Points (ROP)** — enabling smarter procurement and replenishment decisions.

---

##  Objectives

* Forecast **weekly sales (demand)** for each store and department.
* Model the **impact of external factors** — markdowns, holidays, temperature, and fuel price.
* Build an **XGBoost regression model** to predict future demand.
* Calculate **Safety Stock** and **Reorder Point (ROP)** to balance stock availability and cost.
* Develop a **Power BI dashboard** for dynamic visualization of key supply chain KPIs.

##  Key Business Insights

* **Seasonality detected:** Sharp demand peaks during holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.
* **Store size correlation:** Larger stores (Type A) exhibit stronger sales trends and variability.
* **Economic influence:** CPI and unemployment rates showed moderate correlation with sales decline patterns.
* **Promotional effect:** Markdowns significantly boosted short-term sales in specific departments.
* **Model accuracy:** Achieved **RMSE ≈ 3092** and **MAE ≈ 1467**, ensuring reliable sales forecasts.

##  Results

| Metric                                    | Value              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**        | 3092.77            |
| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**             | 1467.23            |
| **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)** | 11.4%              |
| **Total Stores Analyzed**                 | 45                 |
| **Departments Covered**                   | 99                 |
| **Forecast Horizon**                      | Weekly (2010–2013) |

- The model successfully predicted weekly department-wise sales with **high accuracy**, capturing seasonal, economic, and promotional effects.
- Calculated **Safety Stock** and **ROP** enabled dynamic replenishment strategies to minimize stockouts while controlling overstocking.
